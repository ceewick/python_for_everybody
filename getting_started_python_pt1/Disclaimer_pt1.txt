Part_1: 

#Note - Using Python 3.5.2
#Disclaimer - It has been a couple of months since I did the earlier chapters (and initally they 
were in Python... luckily I realized after a few weeks and tried migrating them to Py3. 

About a month in... all of my work was wiped off of my computer (another reason I am backing things
up on here), so I tired to re-work the problems again when I will still getting started BUT on top 
of my elementary development status, the rush might have given more errors or code that is likey 
ugly... still figured worth a share. I know that there's always a better way to do something.

Part 1 Summary:

'''This course aims to teach everyone the basics of programming computers using Python. We cover the 
basics of how one constructs a program from a series of simple instructions in Python.  The course has
no pre-requisites and avoids all but the simplest mathematics. Anyone with moderate computer experience
should be able to master the materials in this course. This course will cover Chapters 1-5 of the 
textbook “Python for Informatics”.   This course is equivalent to the first half of the 11-week 
"Programming for Everybody (Python)" course.  Once a student completes this course, they will be 
ready to take more advanced programming courses. This course covers Python 2.'''
