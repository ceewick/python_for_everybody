Coursera - Python specialization: "Python for Everybody" "Python for Informatics" - http://pythonlearn.com/book.php - Charles R. Severance

The program is on Coursera, through the University of Michigan. There are five different courses in the specialization (I am on 3 of 5). I am just using the program as a guide, in conjunction with the professor's books ("Python for Everybody" & "Python for Informatics") and website/resources. The professors books and program is available for free at http://pythonlearn.com/book.php. Coursera program is https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python

1) Python for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)
2) Python Data Structures
3) Using Python to Acccess the Web
4) Using Databases with Python
5) Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python

I have found another resource that is extremely helpful and includes a LOT of complementary/supplementary information on Python. It is a program called Real Python (the website is down but it's - https://github.com/realpython). They are both good, but for a complete beginner, I would suggest start with this program... go through the first two sections with Coursera, then start with Real Python. It's a little more challenging and has a LOT more detail to help advance what you have learned through the Coursera course. They are both good (in the opinion of someone without a lot of programming experience/knowledge haha!). 

I am posting the solutions on here because I have found other people's solutions extremely helpful along the way, so I wanted to help if
at all possible (though there are plenty of sources on-line from people who are much more advanced then me). Not to mention, I will likely have some questions in the future, so thought this might be a good place to start. Also, I am very open to feedback/suggestions on my code if anyone has some for me. 

Have a great one!
