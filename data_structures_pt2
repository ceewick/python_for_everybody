"This course will introduce the core data structures of the Python programming
language. We will move past the basics of procedural programming and explore 
how we can use the Python built-in data structures such as lists, dictionaries, 
and tuples to perform increasingly complex data analysis. This course will 
cover Chapters 6-10 of the textbook “Python for Informatics”. This course 
is equivalent to the second half of the 11-week "Programming for Everybody 
(Python)" course. This course covers Python 2."

My solutions and notes are for Python 3!!! The course video is Python
2, but the author (Charles Severance) has re-written the book for
Python 3.x!!! It follows along well with the course and previous book.
New book (Python 3) is called "Python for Everybody"... link to free PDF
of book below. For reference on Github, old book is called 
"Python for Informatics". Both by Charles R Severance
