'''9.1 Write a program that reads the words in words.txt and stores them as
keys in a dictionary.  It doesnâ€™t matter what the values are. Then you can
use the in operator as a fast way to check whether a string is in the
dictionary'''

text = file.read()
filespl = text.split()

for word in filespl:
